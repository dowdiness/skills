name: incr
description: Use when writing or reviewing MoonBit code against the `dowdiness/incr` reactive library (v0.6.x+) — building Inputs/Deriveds/ReachableDeriveds (or the compatibility names Signal/Memo/HybridMemo), attaching long-lived derived cells with `Watch`/`Observer`, adding microbenchmarks, or wrapping a reactive pipeline in a struct. Catches recurring idiom misses (inside-vs-outside read semantics, GC-anchor `Watch`/`Observer`, `Type::Type` constructor naming, defensive copies).

# incr

Reference for writing canonical `@incr` code. Adapt to context — these are
patterns the project consistently uses, not enforcement rules.

Citation paths in this skill are repo-relative to **this repo**
(`dowdiness/incr`) unless explicitly qualified with a sister repo
(`dowdiness/loom: …`). The `incr` library is also vendored as a
submodule of the `dowdiness/loom` monorepo; both views host the same
source tree.

## When to Use

Trigger keywords (target facade — preferred for new code):
`@incr.Input`, `@incr.Derived`, `@incr.ReachableDerived`,
`@incr.InputField`, `@incr.EagerDerived`, `@incr.DerivedMap`,
`@incr.Watch`, `@incr.MapRelation`, `Scope::new`, `scope.input`,
`scope.derived`, `scope.reachable_derived`, `scope.eager_derived`,
`.read()`, `.read_or_abort()`, `.get_or_abort()`, `.watch()`.

Trigger keywords (compatibility names — still valid, used by older
loom/canopy code): `Memo::new`, `Signal::new`, `HybridMemo::new`,
`@incr.Observer`, `Reactive`, `scope.memo`, `scope.signal`,
`add_observer`, `.observe()`, `rt.read`, `rt.read_hybrid`,
`rt.read_reactive`.

Also fires on: `parser.runtime()`, `attach_*`, `bench_test.mbt`,
`.bench(` — or any time you are defining a new struct that owns reactive cells
and exposes a `get`/`dispose` surface.

Sister skill: **loom** (parser-side conventions). If the task involves
calling `Parser::new` or `new_parser`, read that one too.

## Naming: Target Facade ↔ Compatibility

Per `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `loom/incr/CLAUDE.md`, v0.6.0 introduced
target facade names as the preferred form for new docs and examples.
Compatibility names remain supported, but ordinary new code should use
the target facades. Keep compatibility handles only where the target
facade intentionally does not expose the behavior yet (accumulators,
low-level memo introspection recipes, or legacy downstream code).

| Compatibility | Target facade |
|---------------|---------------|
| `Signal[T]` | `Input[T]` |
| `Memo[T]` | `Derived[T]` |
| `HybridMemo[T]` | `ReachableDerived[T]` |
| `MemoMap[K, V]` | `DerivedMap[K, V]` |
| `TrackedCell[T]` | `InputField[T]` |
| `Reactive[T]` | `EagerDerived[T]` |
| `Observer[T]` | `Watch[T]` |
| `FunctionalRelation[T]` | `MapRelation[T]` |
| `scope.memo(...)` | `scope.derived(...)` |
| `scope.signal(...)` | `scope.input(...)` |
| `memo.observe()` | `derived.watch()` |
| `rt.read(memo)` | `derived.read()` / `derived.read_or_abort()` |
| `rt.read_hybrid(h)` | `reachable.read()` / `reachable.read_or_abort()` |
| `rt.read_reactive(r)` | `eager.read()` |

`Runtime`, `Scope`, `Accumulator`, `Effect`, `DerivedEvent`, `CycleError`
are the same name in both worlds. New code should pick one column and
stay there per cell chain — don't mix `Memo` and `Derived` for the same
graph unless a compatibility-only API forces that boundary.

**Phase 3a decision (2026-05-26, PR #90):** do **not** add target-vocabulary
bridge methods to compatibility handles (`Memo::read`, `Memo::get_or_abort`,
`MemoMap::read`, etc.). The compatibility handles are eventual cleanup/removal
targets; migrating users to new methods on them would create churn. For ordinary
migration, move the handle type/constructor to `Derived`, `ReachableDerived`, or
`DerivedMap`. No migration script is currently tracked in this repo; use the
API tables and `cells/pkg.generated.mbti` when doing manual rewrites.

## Quick Reference

Rows below show the target facade form first; compatibility-name equivalents in
parentheses.

| Situation | Use | Not |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Read an `Input` from inside any compute closure | `input.get()` | wrapping in `rt.read(...)` — Inputs are non-fallible; `.get()` records the dep at zero observer cost |
| Read a `Derived` / `ReachableDerived` from inside another compute closure | `derived.get_or_abort()` / `reachable.get_or_abort()` (strict) or `.get()` returning `Result` (graceful) | `rt.read(...)`, `.read_or_abort()`, or `.read()` — outside-read APIs do one-shot observer work or obscure the tracked boundary |
| Read an `EagerDerived` from inside another compute closure | `eager.get()` | `eager.read()` — it is permissive and should be reserved for outside-graph reads unless a boundary wrapper deliberately needs that behavior |
| Read a `Derived` (or `Memo`) from outside the reactive graph (tests, top-level, non-tracked consumer methods) | `derived.read_or_abort()` or `derived.read() -> Result` (or persistent `watch.read_or_abort()` / `observer.get()`) | calling strict graph reads (`.get()` / `.get_or_abort()`) outside a tracked context aborts, or records a dependency if a compute frame is unexpectedly active |
| Read a `ReachableDerived` (or `HybridMemo`) from outside the graph | `reachable.read_or_abort()` or `reachable.read()` (or `watch.read_or_abort()`) | mixing `rt.read(h)` — `Runtime::read` is `Memo[T]`-only; for the compat handle, `rt.read_hybrid(h)` works but is the legacy form |
| Read an `EagerDerived` (or `Reactive`) from outside the graph | `eager.read()` (or `watch.read_or_abort()`); compat: `rt.read_reactive(r)` or `observer.get()` | calling `eager.get()` / `reactive.get()` outside a tracked context aborts |
| Read anything after `dispose()` | Don't — disposed cells/observers/watches abort | — |
| Define a new struct's primary constructor | `fn MyStruct::MyStruct(...) -> MyStruct` | `fn MyStruct::new(...) -> MyStruct` (older idiom; `Type::Type` is project convention per `~/.claude/moonbit-base.md`) |
| Attach long-lived derived cells to a parser/runtime | `Scope` + persistent `Watch` (preferred) or `Observer` (compat) — see templates below | Bare `Derived(rt, ...)` / `Memo::new` with no GC root — `rt.gc()` will sweep the chain |
| Use a library-provided constructor | `Input(rt, v, label=...)`, `Derived(rt, f, label=...)`, `ReachableDerived(rt, f, label=...)`, `Runtime()`, `Scope::new(rt)`, `derived.watch()` (or compat: `Memo::new`, `Signal::new`, `memo.observe()`) | Don't rename library APIs — the `Type::Type` convention is for *defining* new structs, not for *calling* upstream library constructors. `Watch` comes from `*.watch()`; `Observer` from `*.observe()`. Neither has `::new`. |

## Inside vs Outside the Graph (the big rule)

The read API splits along one axis: **am I inside a tracked compute
closure or not?**

**Inside a compute closure** (`Derived(rt, f, ...)`, `ReachableDerived`,
`EagerDerived`, `scope.derived`, `scope.reachable_derived`,
`scope.eager_derived` — and the compat equivalents `Memo::new`,
`HybridMemo::new`, `Reactive::new`, `scope.memo`):

- `input.get()` — Inputs are non-fallible; just reads and records the dep.
- `derived.get_or_abort()` / `reachable.get_or_abort()` — strict read; aborts on cycle.
- `derived.get()` / `reachable.get()` — graceful read; returns `Result[T, CycleError]`.
- `eager.get()` — strict tracked read of an eager/push value. `EagerDerived` has no `Result` or `_or_abort` read channel.

These record the dep on the surrounding tracking frame at zero observer
cost.

**Outside the graph** (top-level, tests, event handlers, non-tracked
consumer methods):

- `derived.read_or_abort()` / `reachable.read_or_abort()` — strict; aborts on cycle.
- `derived.read()` / `reachable.read()` — returns `Result[T, CycleError]`.
- `eager.read()` — reads the current eager/push value outside the graph.
- Through a long-lived anchor: `watch.read_or_abort()` / `watch.read()`
  (or compat: `observer.get()`).
- Legacy: `rt.read(memo)` / `rt.read_hybrid(h)` / `rt.read_reactive(r)`
  still work for the compat-named handles.

The target-facade result-returning read channel — `Derived` /
`ReachableDerived` `.get()` / `.read()`, `DerivedMap` `.get(key)` /
`.read(key)`, and `Watch::read()` — currently returns `Result[..., CycleError]`.
`DerivedMap::read_or(...)` and `DerivedMap::read_or_else(...)` return the value
`V` directly after applying their fallback. Disposed cells still abort on strict
reads. Keep generated code matching on `CycleError` until a broader read-error
API appears in `cells/pkg.generated.mbti`.

### Why mixing breaks

Calling `rt.read(memo)` from inside a compute closure (or
`derived.read_or_abort()` / `reachable.read_or_abort()` — same shape)
opens and closes a one-shot observer to do the read, on top of the
tracking frame that's already live. The 2026-05-18 measurement put the
inflation at ~25–30% on layered/tree shapes (see
`feedback_api_misuse_pattern.md`). Correctness is fine, so the bug is
invisible without a microbench.

Calling strict graph reads (`derived.get()`, `derived.get_or_abort()`,
`reachable.get()`, `reachable.get_or_abort()`, `eager.get()`, or compat
`memo.get()` / `reactive.get()`) at top level aborts outside a tracked
context; inside a helper that happens to run during another compute, it
records a dependency on that active frame. Outside code should use
read/watch APIs instead.

### Examples

```moonbit
// ✅ Target facade — inside a Derived body
let total = Derived(
  rt,
  () => subtotal.get_or_abort().to_double() + tax.get_or_abort(),
  label="total",
)

// ✅ Compatibility — inside a Memo body (still valid)
let typed_memo = scope.memo(
  fn() { @typecheck.convert_from_cst(parser.syntax_tree().get_or_abort()) },
  label="typed_term_bridge",
)

// ❌ Inside a compute closure — pays the observer lifecycle every recompute
let typed_memo = scope.memo(
  fn() { @typecheck.convert_from_cst(rt.read(parser.syntax_tree())) },
)

// ✅ Outside the graph — target facade
let snapshot = parser.syntax_tree().read_or_abort()
match total.read() {
  Ok(v) => println("Total: \{v}")
  Err(e) => println(e.format_path())
}

// ✅ Outside the graph — compat path (still works)
let snapshot = rt.read(parser.syntax_tree())

// ✅ Outside the graph through a persistent anchor
let result = attachment.watch.read_or_abort()    // target
let result = attachment.observer.get()           // compat
```

  target facade form (`Input`, `Derived`, `Scope`, `Watch`,
  `read_or_abort`, `get_or_abort`).

  inside-vs-outside rule called out.

## The Persistent-Anchor GC Rule

`Runtime::gc()` marks reachability via BFS from `gc_root_counts`, which
`derived.watch()` / `memo.observe()` increment. One-shot
`derived.read_or_abort()` (or legacy `rt.read(memo)`) creates and
disposes the anchor immediately — so it does NOT keep the cell alive
across a later `gc()`. Interior Deriveds with no anchor get swept;
subsequent reads abort.

**Rule:** if you build a downstream chain that should survive
`Runtime::gc()` (anything stored in a struct field with a public `get`),
hold a persistent `Watch` (target) or `Observer` (compat) on the
terminal Derived/Memo. Target `Watch` values are not registered through `Scope`
in the current API, so store the `Watch` field and dispose it explicitly;
compat `Observer` values can be registered with `Scope::add_observer`. Prime the
terminal read before exposing the facade if `Runtime::gc()` can run before the
first consumer read: an uncomputed watched/observed cell is rooted, but has no
recorded upstream `gc_dependencies()` yet. If the facade keeps a last-good cache,
seed it from that priming read.

GC traversal follows `gc_dependencies()` from anchored roots, so the
parser's interior cells stay reachable as long as one downstream cell is
watched/observed and has been computed at least once.

### Template — target facade (preferred for new code)

```moonbit
pub(all) struct MyAttachment {
  scope : @incr.Scope
  watch : @incr.Watch[Result]
  // ... other cells you need to expose
}

pub fn MyAttachment::attach(
  parser : @loom.Parser[@ast.Term],
) -> MyAttachment {
  let rt = parser.runtime()
  let scope = @incr.Scope::new(rt)
  let stage_one = scope.derived(
    () => do_work(parser.syntax_tree().get_or_abort()),
    label="stage_one",
  )
  let result = scope.derived(
    () => finalize(stage_one.get_or_abort()),
    label="result",
  )
  // Store the watch for explicit disposal, then prime it so a pre-read
  // Runtime::gc() sees the upstream dependencies.
  let watch = result.watch()
  ignore(watch.read_or_abort())
  { scope, watch }
}

pub fn MyAttachment::get(self : MyAttachment) -> Result {
  self.watch.read_or_abort()
}

pub fn MyAttachment::dispose(self : MyAttachment) -> Unit {
  self.watch.dispose()
  self.scope.dispose()
}
```

### Template — compatibility names (still canonical in loom/canopy as of 2026-05-24)

From `dowdiness/loom: examples/lambda/src/typed_parser.mbt` (and
mirrored in `dowdiness/loom: examples/lambda/src/callers/callers.mbt`):

```moonbit
pub(all) struct MyAttachment {
  scope : @incr.Scope
  observer : @incr.Observer[Result]
}

pub fn attach_my_thing(
  parser : @loom.Parser[@ast.Term],
) -> MyAttachment {
  let rt = parser.runtime()
  let scope = @incr.Scope::new(rt)
  let derived = scope.memo(
    fn() { do_work(parser.syntax_tree().get_or_abort()) },
    label="derived_bridge",
  )
  let result = scope.memo(
    fn() { finalize(derived.get_or_abort()) },
    label="derived_result",
  )
  let observer = scope.add_observer(result.observe())
  ignore(observer.get())
  { scope, observer }
}

pub fn MyAttachment::get(self : MyAttachment) -> Result {
  self.observer.get()
}

pub fn MyAttachment::dispose(self : MyAttachment) -> Unit {
  self.scope.dispose()
}
```

Both templates produce the same reachability behavior. Pick a column
per chain and stay there — don't half-migrate one struct.

## Constructor Naming for *New* Structs

Project convention (per `~/.claude/moonbit-base.md` Quick Reference):
**define** new struct types' primary constructor as
`fn Type::Type(...) -> Type`, not `fn Type::new(...) -> Type`. The
miss this rule prevents is definition naming, not call syntax — at the
call site, match nearby code (`Type::Type(args)` or the short-form
`Type(args)` sugar, both work).

```moonbit
// ✅ New struct in user code
pub fn CallersPipeline::CallersPipeline(
  rt : @incr.Runtime,
  syntax : @incr.Derived[@seam.SyntaxNode],   // or @incr.Memo if matching surrounding compat code
) -> CallersPipeline { ... }

let p = CallersPipeline::CallersPipeline(rt, syntax)
```

### What v0.6.x facade names look like at the call site

The target facade ships its constructors using exactly this convention,
so `Input(rt, v)` / `Derived(rt, f)` / `ReachableDerived(rt, f)` /
`InputField(rt, v)` / `Runtime()` are the canonical call forms — no
`::new` and no explicit `Type::Type` qualifier needed at the call site.

```moonbit
let rt = Runtime()
let x = Input(rt, 10, label="x")
let total = Derived(rt, () => x.get() * 2, label="total")
```

The compatibility names still use `::new` because they are aliases for
the older shape:

```moonbit
let rt = Runtime::new()
let x = Signal::new(rt, 10)
let m = Memo::new(rt, () => x.get() * 2)
```

`Scope::new(rt)` is the same in both worlds.

### Don't rename upstream library constructors

`Memo::new`, `Signal::new`, `HybridMemo::new`, `Runtime::new`,
`Scope::new`, `Parser::new` are the names those APIs ship with — call
them as-is. **`Watch` and `Observer` are never constructed**; they
come from `derived.watch()` / `memo.observe()` / `hybrid.observe()` /
`reactive.observe()`. The `Type::Type` rule is for new struct
definitions, not retroactive migration of upstream APIs.

Canonical reference for the convention in use:
`dowdiness/loom: examples/lambda/src/callers/callers.mbt:127` defines
`CallersPipeline::CallersPipeline`.

## Bench Patterns

Canonical reference: `tests/bench_test.mbt`. Copy its surface when
adding new benches. As of 2026-05-24 the bench file uses compatibility
names — that's fine; either column works. Match whatever the file you're
editing already uses.

```moonbit
// Compatibility-name form — matches existing bench_test.mbt
test "memo: get warm (up-to-date, no recompute)" (b : @bench.T) {
  let rt = Runtime::new()
  let sig = Signal::new(rt, 42)
  let m = Memo::new(rt, () => sig.get() * 2)
  ignore(rt.read(m))           // ← prime BEFORE measuring
  b.bench(fn() { b.keep(rt.read(m)) })
}

// Target-facade form — same shape, new vocabulary
test "derived: get warm (up-to-date, no recompute)" (b : @bench.T) {
  let rt = Runtime()
  let x = Input(rt, 42)
  let d = Derived(rt, () => x.get() * 2)
  ignore(d.read_or_abort())    // ← prime BEFORE measuring
  b.bench(fn() { b.keep(d.read_or_abort()) })
}
```

Conventions to match verbatim:

- **Prime, then bench.** Call the outside-graph read once
  (`rt.read(m)` or `d.read_or_abort()`) before `b.bench(...)` to settle
  dependencies and avoid measuring first-touch overhead.
- **Use `b.keep(...)` on the result** so the compiler doesn't dead-code
  the read.
- **`b.bench(fn() { ... })`** is the canonical signature; the closure
  body should be the smallest realistic measurement.
- **Library-API names ship with the column you pick** — `Signal::new` /
  `Memo::new` / `Runtime::new` (compat) or `Input(rt, ...)` /
  `Derived(rt, ...)` / `Runtime()` (target). Don't invent
  `Input::new` — the target facade uses direct-constructor sugar.
- **Inside compute closures use `.get()` (Input/EagerDerived) or
  `.get_or_abort()` / `.get()` (Derived/ReachableDerived); outside use
  `rt.read(...)` (compat), `.read_or_abort()` / `.read()`
  (Derived/ReachableDerived), or `.read()` (EagerDerived).** The bench
  file is the template for both rules at once.
- **Label derived cells** in attached pipelines (`label="..."`) — labels
  show up in introspection, which is the whole point of having them.

## When You're About to Write New Reactive Code — Checklist

Before any non-trivial `Derived(rt, ...)` / `ReachableDerived` /
`EagerDerived` (or compat `Memo::new` / `HybridMemo::new` /
`Reactive::new`) call, ask:

1. **Which column am I in?** Pick target facade
   (`Input`/`Derived`/`Watch`) or compatibility
   (`Signal`/`Memo`/`Observer`) and match the file you're editing.
   Don't half-migrate one chain.
2. **Am I inside a tracked closure?** If yes, use `.get()` for
   `Input` / `EagerDerived`, or `.get_or_abort()` / `.get()` for
   `Derived` / `ReachableDerived` (the latter returns `Result`). If
   outside (top-level, test setup, a public method that's not a compute
   body), use `.read_or_abort()` / `.read()` for `Derived` /
   `ReachableDerived`, `.read()` for `EagerDerived`, `rt.read(...)` /
   `rt.read_hybrid(...)` / `rt.read_reactive(...)` (compat), or a
   persistent `watch.read_or_abort()` / `observer.get()`.
3. **Will this cell survive `rt.gc()`?** If it's owned by a struct with
   a public `get`/`dispose` surface, it needs a `Scope` + persistent
   `Watch` (target) or `Observer` (compat) GC anchor. If it's transient
   (one-shot read, immediately discarded), a bare outside-graph read is
   fine.
4. **Am I defining a new struct constructor?** Name it `Type::Type`,
   not `Type::new`.
5. **Is this a bench?** Prime once outside `b.bench`. Use library names
   from whichever column the bench file already uses. Add a `label=`.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| `rt.read(cell)` or `derived.read_or_abort()` / `reachable.read_or_abort()` inside a compute closure | Bench numbers inflated 25-30% on layered shapes; correctness OK so easy to miss | Replace with `input.get()` / `eager.get()` or `derived.get_or_abort()` / `reachable.get_or_abort()`. Audit the bench file in the same package as the canonical template. |
| Calling strict graph reads (`.get()` / `.get_or_abort()`) from top-level test or handler | Aborts outside a tracked context, or records a surprising dependency if a compute frame is active | Use `.read_or_abort()` / `.read()` for `Derived` / `ReachableDerived`, `.read()` for `EagerDerived`, or `rt.read(...)` / `rt.read_hybrid(...)` / `rt.read_reactive(...)` for compat handles. |
| Forgot the GC anchor or priming read on an `attach_*` helper | Tests pass until `rt.gc()` runs before the first read; then `attachment.get()` aborts | Target: store `result.watch()`, prime with `watch.read_or_abort()`, and dispose the watch explicitly. Compat: store `scope.add_observer(result.observe())` and prime with `observer.get()`. |
| Mixed `Memo`/`Derived` for the same chain | Reviewers/Codex flag the inconsistency; types still align because of aliasing so it compiles | Pick one column per chain. |
| Defined `MyType::new(...)` for a new struct | Inconsistent with project convention; Codex/code review will flag | Rename to `MyType::MyType(...)`. |
| Wrote `Input::new(...)` / `Derived::new(...)` | Target facade ships direct constructors, not `::new` | Use `Input(rt, v, label=...)` / `Derived(rt, f, label=...)` directly. |
| Forgot to prime in a bench | First-touch cost shows up in the warm baseline | Add `ignore(rt.read(m))` (compat) or `ignore(d.read_or_abort())` (target) before `b.bench(...)`. |

## Red Flags — Pause and Verify

- About to type `rt.read(`, `derived.read_or_abort()`, or
  `reachable.read_or_abort()` inside a closure passed to `Derived` /
  `ReachableDerived` / `EagerDerived` / `Memo::new` /
  `HybridMemo::new` / `Reactive::new` / `scope.derived` / `scope.memo` /
  `scope.reachable_derived` / `scope.eager_derived` /
  `scope.hybrid_memo` / `scope.reactive` → switch to `.get()` (Input /
  EagerDerived) or `.get_or_abort()` (Derived / ReachableDerived).
- About to type `eager.read()` inside a tracked closure → prefer
  `eager.get()` so the code documents that it requires a compute frame.
- About to type `rt.read(h)` on a `HybridMemo` or `rt.read(r)` on a
  `Reactive` (outside the graph) → use `rt.read_hybrid` /
  `rt.read_reactive`, or a persistent `observer.get()`. For target
  names, call `reachable.read_or_abort()` / `eager.read()`.
- About to define `fn MyType::new(` for a brand-new struct → switch to
  `fn MyType::MyType(`.
- About to call `Input::new(...)` or `Derived::new(...)` → the target
  facade ships direct constructors; drop the `::new`.
- A struct field is `priv derived : @incr.Derived[T]` (or
  `priv memo : @incr.Memo[T]`) with a public `get` / `dispose` and no
  `watch : @incr.Watch[T]` / `observer : @incr.Observer[T]` field →
  missing GC anchor.
- A bench body that calls `Signal::set` / `input.set` then a read with
  no prime above it → first iteration measures cold path.
- Mixing names within one cell chain (`Memo` upstream, `Derived`
  downstream, or `.observe()` plus `.watch()`) → pick one column.

Reading these is the fastest way to ground a change. Cite paths, don't
paraphrase.

  migrate old handles directly to target facades rather than adding bridge
  methods to compatibility handles.

  for new docs/examples.

In sister repo `dowdiness/loom` (where the incr library is consumed by
real parser pipelines — these are the canonical user-facing examples
and still use compatibility names as of 2026-05-24):

- `examples/lambda/src/typed_parser.mbt` — canonical `Scope` +
  persistent `Observer` + `dispose` lifecycle on a parser attachment.
- `examples/lambda/src/callers/callers.mbt` — second example of the
  same pattern, plus defensive `.copy()` on cached buckets and the
  `Type::Type` constructor convention.
